# TOOLSET USER DOCUMENT
*COVERS TOOLSET-HD AND TOOLSET-APPS.*
## INTRODUCTION
### BACKGROUND
Toolset is a revision to a helpful tool called The Panel developed by Cole Tirpak. The Panel was loosely based on a previous concept made by Cole called the Restart Tool. The Panel was a more robust tool created to simplify mundane tasks frequently performed by the Help Desk. Toolset reworked The Panel’s appearance and file structure as well as implemented new features.<br>
